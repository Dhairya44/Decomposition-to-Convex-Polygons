# Decomposition of a polygon to a convex polygon

This is an implementation of the paper titled "Algorithms for the decomposition of a polygon into ÃÅconvex polygons."

The DCEL data structure (https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2020/cmsc754/Lects/lect10-dcel.pdf) was used for the implementation since it provides an easier implementation for planar structures.

We also implemented a visualizer to check the correctness of the algorithm. We have also generated a detailed report using Doxygen.
